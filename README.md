This project sets up a data pipeline using Kafka for real-time data ingestion, AWS S3 for data storage, AWS Glue for data processing, and AWS Athena for querying. The overall flow includes sending data via Kafka producers, consuming data via Kafka consumers, storing it in an S3 bucket, creating a schema using AWS Glue crawlers, and querying the data using AWS Athena.

Project Architecture:

1. Data Ingestion via Kafka:
a. Kafka Producer: The producer sends real-time data streams to a Kafka topic.
b. Kafka Consumer: The consumer listens to the Kafka topic and processes the data.

2. Data Storage on S3:
a. The consumer saves the processed data to an AWS S3 bucket for long-term storage and further processing.

3. AWS Glue Crawler:
a. An AWS Glue Crawler is set up to crawl the data stored in the S3 bucket, automatically detecting the schema and creating a database and tables for querying the data.

4. Data Querying with Athena:
a. Using AWS Athena, you can query the data stored in the S3 bucket through the schema created by AWS Glue

Requirements:

1. Kafka (Producer, Consumer setup)
2. AWS EC2 (For Kafka & Zookeeper)
3. AWS S3 (For data storage)
4. AWS Glue (For schema discovery and cataloging)
5. AWS Athena (For querying)

Future Enhancements:
1. Integrate AWS Lambda for serverless data transformation.
2. Set up Kafka Connect to directly stream data from Kafka to S3.
3. Automate the workflow using AWS Step Functions or Airflow.

Running KafkaSetup.sh

1. SSH into EC2
2. create a file kafkaSetup.sh (nano KafkaSetup.sh)
3. Copy the content and save
4. Give execution permission (chmod +x kafka_setup.sh)
5. Run the script (./kafka_setup.sh)

Necessary roles and permission will have to be granted. It can be done via IAM
